      Reese's Cups is a website for people to enjoy life when things get
      boring. It can cure apathy, mess with your time, and help you

      Games has exquisite games, they are always willing to have great games,
      and the creator is such a cool guy. I couldn't ask for a better site. I am
      very greatful that this site exists. The creator is always open for game
      requests, and I really really like that. I think he is doing an amazing
      job and could do better. A little. Overall, I would give it 4.8/5 stars. I
